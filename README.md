## üîß How to Install

Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 20+ / Podman
- (Podman only) podman-docker (Debian: `apt install podman-docker`)
- OS:
  - Major Linux distros that can run Docker/Podman such as:
     - ‚úÖ Ubuntu
     - ‚úÖ Debian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ‚úÖ Raspbian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ‚úÖ CentOS
     - ‚úÖ Fedora
     - ‚úÖ ArchLinux
  - ‚ùå Debian/Raspbian Buster or lower is not supported
  - ‚ùå Windows (Will be supported later)
- Arch: armv7, arm64, amd64 (a.k.a x86_64)

### Basic

- Default Stacks Directory: `/opt/stacks`
- Default Port: 5001

```
# Create directories that store your stacks and stores Dockge's stack
mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge
cd /opt/dockge

# Download the compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobi1449/dockge/master/compose.yaml --output compose.yaml

# Start the server
docker compose up -d

# If you are using docker-compose V1 or Podman
# docker-compose up -d
```

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

### Advanced

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can generate your compose.yaml file by using the following URL with custom query strings.

```
# Download your compose.yaml
curl "https://dockge.kuma.pet/compose.yaml?port=5001&stacksPath=/opt/stacks" --output compose.yaml
```

- port=`5001`
- stacksPath=`/opt/stacks`

Interactive compose.yaml generator is available on: 
https://dockge.kuma.pet

## How to Update

```bash
cd /opt/dockge
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Others

Dockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  also known as `docker-compose.yml`.

`compose.yaml` file above is great if cloning and building locally, otherwise, you can use this `docker-compose.yml` file to run docker command:
`docker compose up -d` just edit the approprite fields `[USER]`, `[CONFIG_LOCATION_FOR_DOCKGE]`, and `[PATH_TO_STACKS_DIRECTORY]`:
```
services:
  dockge:
    image: ghcr.io/tobi1449/dockge:latest
    container_name: dockge
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Tell Dockge where is your stacks directory
      DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR: /opt/stacks
    ports:
      # Host Port : Container Port
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /var/run/docker.sock
        target: /var/run/docker.sock
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      - type: bind
        source: /home/[USER]/[CONFIG_LOCATION_FOR_DOCKGE]
        target: /app/data
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      # If you want to use private registries, you need to share the auth file with Dockge:
      # - /root/.docker/:/root/.docker

      # Stacks Directory
      # ‚ö†Ô∏è READ IT CAREFULLY. If you did it wrong, your data could end up writing into a WRONG PATH.
      # ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. FULL path only. No relative path (MUST)
      # ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Left Stacks Path === Right Stacks Path (MUST)
      - type: bind
        source: /home/[USER]/[PATH_TO_STACKS_DIRECTORY]
        target: /opt/stacks
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
